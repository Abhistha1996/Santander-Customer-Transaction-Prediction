# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction
To identify who will make a transaction.


In this challenge, I tried to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.

There was an imbalance in ta dataset which led to inaccurate results and hence I undersampled the data due to CPU issues. I do believe that that the accuracy obtained, can 
be increased with additive oversampling. Data Set link : https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/data

I am a beginner when it cmes to data science and hence I would really appreciate some feedbacks.
